# ResilienceEnhancementQuantumToolkit (REQT)

## Overview
REQT is an open-source educational toolkit for learning ML-driven noise-aware compilation in NISQ quantum devices. It teaches key QC concepts like error mitigation, circuit optimization under noise, and integrating ML (e.g., graph neural networks or reinforcement learning) for noise prediction and adaptation. Built with Python, QuTiP, and Qiskit, it's designed for beginners—focus on learning, not production.

## Features
- Parse and compile quantum circuits with noise-aware optimizations.
- Apply ML models to predict and mitigate noise in simulations.
- Tutorials and visualizations to explain concepts step-by-step.
- Support for custom noise models and datasets like QDataSet.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/alarionov/REQT.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run an example: `jupyter notebook examples/basic_circuit.ipynb`
